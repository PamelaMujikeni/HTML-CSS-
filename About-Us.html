            <h1 class="h-about">About Us</h1>
                <p class="h-primary"> As massive cakeaholics, we’re obsessed with the taste, texture and freshness of our cakes. It’s for that reason 
                    that we hand bake our cakes on site using Fair Trade, Organic or the best ingredients we can source, which is reflected
                    in the quality of our cakes.
        
                    Based out of Southampton, we’re proud to cover the entire South Coast and, upon request are able to deliver within Hampshire 
                    and Dorset for a small fee. We’re also able to provide great tasting vegetarian and vegan cakes, and can cater for food allergies
                    and intolerances.
                </p>
                <p class="h-primary">
                    Whatever the occasion, we believe that you can trust Cake Shop to create you a stunning, tailor-made cake that’ll 
                    taste great and wow your guests. It’s our mission to deliver unique, one-of-a-kind cakes that have been lovingly handmade.

                    We think that cakes should reflect the personalities of their recipients. Whether it’s tasteful flowers, wacky and vibrant 
                    explosions of colour, a fantastic fault line cake or something a little more risqué, we’ll completely customise your cake to
                    match your needs. We don’t just limit our cakes to vanilla, lemon, chocolate and fruit either – we’re able to create a deliciously 
                    moist cake in any flavor you ask, with fillings to complement.

                    Whether you’re celebrating a birthday or need the perfect wedding cake, we’re confident that we’ll be able to exceed your
                    expectations and create something truly memorable! Take a look at our portfolio or contact us today for a quote.
