# HTML-CSS-

I have got the hang of HTML basics, there is a lot more to learn but for now i know what i need to build a basic website. 
this week I’ve begun to look at CSS (Cascading Styles Sheets) and how these can interact with my HTML pages to provide styles to my pages. 
the syntax is easy to learn and again, i got the basics pretty quickly.  
In this exercise i pull HTML and CSS basics together to create a website for a "client" - She is baker from london and wants a colourful website that includes:
-At least 4 pages (including the homepage/landing page)  
-A range of media content 
-A ‘Contact Us’ page with a working form 
-An order page (or similar) with a working form
